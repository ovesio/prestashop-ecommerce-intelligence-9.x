# Ovesio - Ecommerce Intelligence for PrestaShop 9.x
**Ovesio - Ecommerce Intelligence** empowers your PrestaShop store with advanced AI-driven insights, stock management forecasting, and strategic consulting. This module generates secure data feeds for your products and orders, allowing the Ovesio platform to analyze your business performance in real-time.

## Features

Connect your store to Ovesio to unlock powerful capabilities:

### 📦 Stock Management & Loss Prevention
*   **Reorder Point (ROP):** Know exactly when to restock to strictly avoid stockouts.
*   **Urgency Status:** Get immediate "Danger" alerts for critical low-stock items.
*   **Lost Sales Estimation:** Calculate revenue lost (past and potential) due to inventory shortages.
*   **Days of Inventory (DOI):** Visualize how many days your current stock will last based on sales velocity.

### 📈 Forecasting & Growth
*   **Sales Forecast:** AI-driven predictions for unit sales over the next 3, 6, or 12 months for better budgeting.

*   **Trend Detection:** Automatically detect if a product lifecycle is Trending UP, DOWN, or is FLAT.

### 💰 Capital & Warehouse Efficiency
*   **Inventory Turnover:** Measure how fast your capital cycles through stock; higher efficiency means better cash flow.
*   **Overstock Risk:** Identify "money-traps"—products sitting too long in the warehouse that tie up profitable capital.
*   **ABC Analysis:** Automatically segment products into Stars (Top Sellers) and Slow/Dead Movers.

### 🏷️ Pricing Strategy & Cross-Selling

*   **Sell-Through Ratio:** Track the percentage of received inventory sold within a specific period.
*   **Cross-Selling Suggestions:** Discover "Bought Together" patterns to create high-value bundles and increase Average Order Value.

### 🤖 Personalized AI Consulting
*   **Overall Verdict:** A quick executive summary diagnosing the product's health.
*   **Action Plan:** Clear, actionable instructions generated by AI (e.g., "Order 20 units now", "Increase price by 10%").
